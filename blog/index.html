Between 2000 and 2020, the number of eligible Latino voters doubled from 13 million to over 32 million. In key states like Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, and Texas, Latino voters have become decisive swing constituencies capable of determining statewide and national elections. This growth reflects both immigration and the coming of age of US-born Latinos, creating a uniquely young and dynamic electorate. Yet registration and turnout rates still lag behind other groups, representing both an enormous challenge and an extraordinary opportunity for organizations committed to closing the participation gap.</p></div><div class="card"><h3>Why Young Latinos Are Redefining Civic Engagement</h3><p>Traditional measures of political engagement — party registration, campaign donations, voting frequency — don't capture how young Latinos are actually participating in democracy. They're organizing mutual aid networks, leading climate strikes, building community media platforms, and running for local office at unprecedented rates. They're bilingual bridge-builders who connect immigrant parents to American institutions while pushing those institutions to be more inclusive. Their political identity is intersectional — shaped by race, immigration status, economic class, and generation — and their engagement reflects that complexity. Understanding and supporting these new forms of participation is essential for anyone serious about building lasting Latino political power.</p></div></div></div></section>
